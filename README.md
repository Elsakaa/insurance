Worked on a data analysis project in the insurance industry using the Python programming language and the Keggle library. Cleaned the data and trained a Random Forest model to identify factors affecting insurance and improve future performance predictions. The project produced promising results and showcased technical skills in statistical analysis and machine learning at a professional level.
