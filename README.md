I worked on a data analysis project in insurance using Python programming language and the Keggle library. I cleaned the data and trained a Random Forest model to identify factors affecting insurance and improve future performance predictions. The project yielded promising results and showcased my technical skills in statistical analysis and machineÂ learning.
